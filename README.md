# CHIP-8 Interpreter

This project is (yet another) Rust CHIP-8 Interpreter. It's my first project exploring the emulation space as well as my first Rust project.

For the frontend, I used the [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/rust_minifb) crate to display a window.

## Future Work
* Test on Windows
* Display in the browser
* Port to Android
